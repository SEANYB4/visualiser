**Visualiser**



*This is a project designed to aid the learning of algorithms and data structures concepts through visualisation*


Whilst completing the backend development training at boot.dev I felt that I could use some additional practice with some of the concepts from the Algorithms and Data Structures course. I decided to build a project that would force to implement each of the algorithms and data structures that were covered, and therefore chose to build a visualiser for each of the concepts that had been covered.
